# Collect Twitter Data with Twarc!

[Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) is a command line tool and Python library for archiving Twitter JSON data, developed as part of the [Documenting the Now](http://www.docnow.io)
project. In addition to letting you collect tweets, twarc can also help you
collect users, trends and hydrate tweet ids.

The included pages provide step-by-step tutorials on installing and using twarc, for both Windows and Mac users. Parts of this guide are subject to change with updates to Twitter developer terms, so please use this guide as a general guideline. For troubleshooting with twarc, please contact the developers of [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/), and join in conversation with the DocNow community of scholars, students, and archivists.
