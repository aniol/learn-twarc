# About

This site was built to provide classroom materials and help support twarc users, thanks in part to a [Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/) grant.

The included pages provide instructions on installing and using Twarc. Parts of this guide are subject to change with updates to Twitter's developers site, so please use this guide as a general guideline. For troubleshooting with Twarc, please contact the developers of [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/), and join in conversation with the DocNow community of scholars, students, and archivists.

For more information on Twarc or other DocNow tools, please visit their [site](https://www.docnow.io/).
